# SDXL Turbo Colab Notebook

This Python Notebook is designed for running the SDXL Turbo models on Google Colab with a T4 GPU. These open-source models are entirely free for you to use as much as you'd like, enabling you to synthesize high-resolution images with few-step inference. Don't forget to share this resource with your friends, and happy synthesizing! ðŸ˜ƒ You can use these models to generate realistic and diverse images from various domains, such as faces, animals, landscapes, and more.

**You can Also Try on Google Colab for free & Make Sure to follow me:**

## Models

Currently it only contain one Turbo Model of SDXL

## How to use

To use the SDXL Turbo models, you need to have a Google account and access to Google Colab. You can try the models for free on Google Colab by following these steps:

<b>

### 1. Open the [LCM LoRA Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ayush-thakur02/SDXL-Turbo/blob/main/SDXL_Turbo.ipynb) in your browser.
